### Regular Coverage Assessment
- **Coverage Rate**: Proportion of confidence intervals containing the true parameter (target: 0.95)
- **Status**:
  - **Good** (Green): Coverage within 5% of nominal level (0.90-1.00)
  - **Marginal** (Yellow): Coverage deviates 5-10% from nominal level
  - **Poor** (Red): Coverage deviates more than 10% from nominal level

### Sensitivity Analysis Assessment
- **Coverage Rate**: Proportion of confidence intervals containing the true parameter under confounding
- **Status**:
  - **Expected (High Bias)** (Blue): Coverage significantly below nominal due to substantial bias
  - **Moderate Bias** (Yellow): Moderate deviation suggesting moderate confounding effects
  - **Low Bias** (Green): Coverage close to nominal despite confounding setup
