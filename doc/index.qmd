The website contains coverage simulations for the [DoubleML](https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/index.html)-package.

Most simulations are based on the [dataset generators](https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/api/api.html#dataset-generators) provided by the package, but sometimes contain slight deviations.
You can find the code for the simulations in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DoubleML/doubleml-coverage/tree/main).
