title: "DoubleML Coverage"
---

The website contains coverage simulations for the [DoubleML](https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/index.html)-package.

Most simulations are based on the [dataset generators](https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/api/api.html#dataset-generators) provided by the package, but sometimes contain slight deviations.

Generally the simulations are based on the following setup:

 * $1000$ observations
 * `green` if the deviation to the nominal level is below $5\%$
 * `yellow` if the deviation to the nominal level is above $5\%$ and below $10\%$
 * `red` if the deviation to the nominal level is above $10\%$
