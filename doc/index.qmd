title: "DoubleML Coverage"
---

The website contains coverage simulations for the [DoubleML](https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/index.html)-package.

Most simulations are based on the [dataset generators](https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/api/api.html#dataset-generators) provided by the package, but sometimes contain slight deviations.
You can find the code for the simulations in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DoubleML/doubleml-coverage/tree/main).

The corresponding coverage results are highlighted according to the following color scheme:

* <span style="background-color: #00FF00; color: black; padding: 2px 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Green</span> if the deviation to the nominal level is below $5\%$
* <span style="background-color: #FFFF00; color: black; padding: 2px 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Yellow</span> if the deviation to the nominal level is above $5\%$ and below $10\%$
* <span style="background-color: #FF0000; color: black; padding: 2px 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Red</span> if the deviation to the nominal level is above $10\%$
