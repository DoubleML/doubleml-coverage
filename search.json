As the DGP is nonlinear, we will only use corresponding learners. Since the DGP includes unobserved confounders, we would expect a bias in the ATE estimates, leading to low coverage of the true parameter.\nBoth sensitivity parameters are set to \\(cf_y=cf_d=0.1\\), such that the robustness value \\(RV\\) should be approximately \\(10\\%\\). Further, the corresponding confidence intervals are one-sided (since the direction of the bias is unkown), such that only one side should approximate the corresponding coverage level (here only the upper coverage is relevant since the bias is positive).

    "text": "Sensitivity\nThe simulations are based on the the ADD-DGP with \\(10,000\\) observations. As the DGP is nonlinear, we will only use corresponding learners. Since the DGP includes an unobserved confounder, we would expect a bias in the ATE estimates, leading to low coverage of the true parameter.\nThe confounding is set such that both sensitivity parameters are approximately \\(cf_y=cf_d=0.1\\), such that the robustness value \\(RV\\) should be approximately \\(10\\%\\). Further, the corresponding confidence intervals are one-sided (since the direction of the bias is unkown), such that only one side should approximate the corresponding coverage level (here only the lower coverage is relevant since the bias is positive). Remark that for the coverage level the value of \\(\\rho\\) has to be correctly specified, such that the coverage level will be generally (significantly) larger than the nominal level under the conservative choice of \\(|\\rho|=1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nThis is the init_notebook_mode cell from ITables v2.1.4\n(you should not see this message - is your notebook trusted?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATE\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage for 95.0%-Confidence Interval over 500 Repetitions\n\n\nLearner l\nLearner m\nBias\nBias (Lower)\nBias (Upper)\nCoverage\nCoverage (Lower)\nCoverage (Upper)\nRV\nRVa\n\n\n\n\nLGBM\nLGBM\n0.099\n0.028\n0.171\n0.000\n0.896\n1.000\n0.137\n0.083\n\n\nLGBM\nLogistic Regr.\n0.082\n0.013\n0.151\n0.000\n1.000\n1.000\n0.117\n0.060\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nLGBM\n0.098\n0.026\n0.171\n0.000\n0.952\n1.000\n0.133\n0.080\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nLogistic Regr.\n0.013\n0.060\n0.082\n1.000\n1.000\n1.000\n0.019\n0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage for 90.0%-Confidence Interval over 500 Repetitions\n\n\nLearner l\nLearner m\nBias\nBias (Lower)\nBias (Upper)\nCoverage\nCoverage (Lower)\nCoverage (Upper)\nRV\nRVa\n\n\n\n\nLGBM\nLGBM\n0.099\n0.028\n0.171\n0.000\n0.636\n1.000\n0.137\n0.095\n\n\nLGBM\nLogistic Regr.\n0.082\n0.013\n0.151\n0.000\n0.980\n1.000\n0.117\n0.073\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nLGBM\n0.098\n0.026\n0.171\n0.000\n0.732\n1.000\n0.133\n0.092\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nLogistic Regr.\n0.013\n0.060\n0.082\n1.000\n1.000\n1.000\n0.019\n0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATTE\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage for 95.0%-Confidence Interval over 500 Repetitions\n\n\nLearner l\nLearner m\nBias\nBias (Lower)\nBias (Upper)\nCoverage\nCoverage (Lower)\nCoverage (Upper)\nRV\nRVa\n\n\n\n\nLGBM\nLGBM\n0.125\n0.021\n0.256\n0.006\n0.988\n1.000\n0.096\n0.055\n\n\nLGBM\nLogistic Regr.\n0.124\n0.021\n0.250\n0.008\n0.988\n1.000\n0.098\n0.056\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nLGBM\n0.126\n0.021\n0.259\n0.006\n0.992\n1.000\n0.095\n0.055\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nLogistic Regr.\n0.040\n0.091\n0.168\n0.846\n1.000\n1.000\n0.032\n0.003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage for 90.0%-Confidence Interval over 500 Repetitions\n\n\nLearner l\nLearner m\nBias\nBias (Lower)\nBias (Upper)\nCoverage\nCoverage (Lower)\nCoverage (Upper)\nRV\nRVa\n\n\n\n\nLGBM\nLGBM\n0.125\n0.021\n0.256\n0.004\n0.982\n1.000\n0.096\n0.065\n\n\nLGBM\nLogistic Regr.\n0.124\n0.021\n0.250\n0.006\n0.970\n1.000\n0.098\n0.065\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nLGBM\n0.126\n0.021\n0.259\n0.002\n0.984\n1.000\n0.095\n0.064\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nLogistic Regr.\n0.040\n0.091\n0.168\n0.726\n1.000\n1.000\n0.032\n0.007"
