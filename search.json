    "text": "ATE Sensitivity\nThe simulations are based on the the ADD-DGP with \\(10,000\\) observations. As the DGP is nonlinear, we will only use corresponding learners. Since the DGP includes an unobserved confounder, we would expect a bias in the ATE estimates, leading to low coverage of the true parameter.\nThe confounding is set such that both sensitivity parameters are approximately \\(cf_y=cf_d=0.1\\), such that the robustness value \\(RV\\) should be approximately \\(10\\%\\). Further, the corresponding confidence intervals are one-sided (since the direction of the bias is unkown), such that only one side should approximate the corresponding coverage level (here only the upper coverage is relevant since the bias is positive). Remark that for the coverage level the value of \\(\\rho\\) has to be correctly specified, such that the coverage level will be generally (significantly) larger than the nominal level under the conservative choice of \\(|\\rho|=1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nThis is the init_notebook_mode cell from ITables v2.1.4\n(you should not see this message - is your notebook trusted?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Coverage for 95.0%-Confidence Interval over 50 Repetitions\n\n\n\n\n\nLearner l\nLearner m\nBias\nBias (Lower)\nBias (Upper)\nCoverage\nCoverage (Lower)\nCoverage (Upper)\nRV\nRVa\n\n\n\n\nLGBM\nLGBM\n0.205\n0.708\n0.323\n0.780\n1.000\n1.000\n0.043\n0.006\n\n\nLGBM\nLogistic Regr.\n0.337\n0.840\n0.197\n0.580\n1.000\n1.000\n0.070\n0.019\n\n\nLGBM\nRandom Forest\n0.353\n0.879\n0.187\n0.280\n1.000\n1.000\n0.071\n0.031\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nLGBM\n0.466\n1.915\n1.005\n0.960\n1.000\n1.000\n0.034\n0.001\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nLogistic Regr.\n5.622\n7.059\n4.184\n0.000\n1.000\n0.000\n0.348\n0.296\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nRandom Forest\n1.011\n2.497\n0.486\n0.400\n1.000\n1.000\n0.072\n0.018\n\n\nRandom Forest\nLGBM\n0.426\n1.540\n0.697\n0.800\n1.000\n1.000\n0.041\n0.005\n\n\nRandom Forest\nLogistic Regr.\n0.854\n1.955\n0.331\n0.400\n1.000\n1.000\n0.081\n0.028\n\n\nRandom Forest\nRandom Forest\n0.834\n1.974\n0.329\n0.160\n1.000\n1.000\n0.077\n0.035\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Coverage for 90.0%-Confidence Interval over 50 Repetitions\n\n\n\n\n\nLearner l\nLearner m\nBias\nBias (Lower)\nBias (Upper)\nCoverage\nCoverage (Lower)\nCoverage (Upper)\nRV\nRVa\n\n\n\n\nLGBM\nLGBM\n0.205\n0.708\n0.323\n0.680\n1.000\n1.000\n0.043\n0.011\n\n\nLGBM\nLogistic Regr.\n0.337\n0.840\n0.197\n0.440\n1.000\n1.000\n0.070\n0.027\n\n\nLGBM\nRandom Forest\n0.353\n0.879\n0.187\n0.220\n1.000\n1.000\n0.071\n0.039\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nLGBM\n0.466\n1.915\n1.005\n0.960\n1.000\n1.000\n0.034\n0.002\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nLogistic Regr.\n5.622\n7.059\n4.184\n0.000\n1.000\n0.000\n0.348\n0.308\n\n\nLinear Reg.\nRandom Forest\n1.011\n2.497\n0.486\n0.180\n1.000\n1.000\n0.072\n0.029\n\n\nRandom Forest\nLGBM\n0.426\n1.540\n0.697\n0.700\n1.000\n1.000\n0.041\n0.009\n\n\nRandom Forest\nLogistic Regr.\n0.854\n1.955\n0.331\n0.200\n1.000\n0.980\n0.081\n0.039\n\n\nRandom Forest\nRandom Forest\n0.834\n1.974\n0.329\n0.100\n1.000\n0.980\n0.077\n0.044"

As the DGP is nonlinear, we will only use corresponding learners. Since the DGP includes unobserved confounders, we would expect a bias in the ATE estimates, leading to low coverage of the true parameter.\nBoth sensitivity parameters are set to \\(cf_y=cf_d=0.1\\), such that the robustness value \\(RV\\) should be approximately \\(10\\%\\). Further, the corresponding confidence intervals are one-sided (since the direction of the bias is unkown), such that only one side should approximate the corresponding coverage level (here only the upper coverage is relevant since the bias is positive). Remark that for the coverage level the value of \\(\\rho\\) has to be correctly specified, such that the coverage level will be generally (significantly) larger than the nominal level under the conservative choice of \\(|\\rho|=1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nThis is the init_notebook_mode cell from ITables v2.1.4\n(you should not see this message - is your notebook trusted?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartialling out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Coverage for 95.0%-Confidence Interval over 1000 Repetitions\n\n\n\n\n\nLearner l\nLearner m\nBias\nBias (Lower)\nBias (Upper)\nCoverage\nCoverage (Lower)\nCoverage (Upper)\nRV\nRVa\n\n\n\n\nLGBM\nLGBM\n0.967\n1.680\n0.322\n0.093\n1.000\n0.939\n0.130\n0.057\n\n\nLGBM\nRandom Forest\n0.984\n1.805\n0.290\n0.191\n1.000\n0.979\n0.116\n0.042\n\n\nRandom Forest\nLGBM\n1.700\n2.876\n0.535\n0.002\n1.000\n0.842\n0.141\n0.079\n\n\nRandom Forest\nRandom Forest\n1.742\n3.067\n0.473\n0.027\n1.000\n0.936\n0.128\n0.064\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Coverage for 90.0%-Confidence Interval over 1000 Repetitions\n\n\n\n\n\nLearner l\nLearner m\nBias\nBias (Lower)\nBias (Upper)\nCoverage\nCoverage (Lower)\nCoverage (Upper)\nRV\nRVa\n\n\n\n\nLGBM\nLGBM\n0.967\n1.680\n0.322\n0.045\n1.000\n0.832\n0.130\n0.072\n\n\nLGBM\nRandom Forest\n0.984\n1.805\n0.290\n0.102\n1.000\n0.936\n0.116\n0.057\n\n\nRandom Forest\nLGBM\n1.700\n2.876\n0.535\n0.000\n1.000\n0.641\n0.141\n0.093\n\n\nRandom Forest\nRandom Forest\n1.742\n3.067\n0.473\n0.005\n1.000\n0.829\n0.128\n0.078\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIV-type\nFor the IV-type score, the learners ml_l and ml_g are both set to the same type of learner (here Learner g).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Coverage for 95.0%-Confidence Interval over 1000 Repetitions\n\n\n\n\n\nLearner g\nLearner m\nBias\nBias (Lower)\nBias (Upper)\nCoverage\nCoverage (Lower)\nCoverage (Upper)\nRV\nRVa\n\n\n\n\nLGBM\nLGBM\n0.694\n1.383\n0.285\n0.676\n1.000\n0.999\n0.096\n0.014\n\n\nLGBM\nRandom Forest\n0.925\n1.695\n0.269\n0.193\n1.000\n0.991\n0.116\n0.041\n\n\nRandom Forest\nLGBM\n0.864\n2.070\n0.468\n0.817\n1.000\n1.000\n0.071\n0.007\n\n\nRandom Forest\nRandom Forest\n1.618\n2.946\n0.397\n0.044\n1.000\n0.977\n0.119\n0.056\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8: Coverage for 90.0%-Confidence Interval over 1000 Repetitions\n\n\n\n\n\nLearner g\nLearner m\nBias\nBias (Lower)\nBias (Upper)\nCoverage\nCoverage (Lower)\nCoverage (Upper)\nRV\nRVa\n\n\n\n\nLGBM\nLGBM\n0.694\n1.383\n0.285\n0.488\n1.000\n0.991\n0.096\n0.027\n\n\nLGBM\nRandom Forest\n0.925\n1.695\n0.269\n0.101\n1.000\n0.942\n0.116\n0.056\n\n\nRandom Forest\nLGBM\n0.864\n2.070\n0.468\n0.649\n1.000\n1.000\n0.071\n0.016\n\n\nRandom Forest\nRandom Forest\n1.618\n2.946\n0.397\n0.013\n1.000\n0.899\n0.119\n0.070"
